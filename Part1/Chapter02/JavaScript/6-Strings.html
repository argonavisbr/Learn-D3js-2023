    // If you need to use a special character in a string, such as a double quote in a double quoted string,
    // or a backslash, you need to precede it with another backslash:

    const s = "This is a backslash \\ and this is a double quote \"";
    console.log(s);

    // Concatenation
    const x = 25;
    const example1 = 'The square root of ' + x + ' is ' + Math.sqrt(x);
    console.log(example1);

    const v1 = "5";			// type String: if used in addition, will concatenate
    const v2 = +v1; 		// converts to type Number
    const v3 = parseInt(v1); 	// also converts to type Number
    console.log("v1 + 10", v1 + 10);

    // Multiline strings (in code) can be created adding a backslash at the end of each line:

    const line =
        "Multiline strings can be \
         created adding a backslash \
         at the end of each line";
    console.log(line);

    // This is just a convenience and doesn't actually introduce any line breaks in the text:
    document.getElementById("text").innerText = line;

    // But you don't need a backslash if your string is quoted with backticks:
    const line2 =
        `Multiline strings can also be
         created without any backslash
         if you use backticks`;
    console.log(line);

    // Template literals (string interpolation) are strings created with backticks.
    // JavaScript expressions can be placed inside ${} placeholders.
    // The result is concatenated as a single string.
