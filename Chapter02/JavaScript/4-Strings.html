    // Multiline strings (in code) can be created adding a backslash at the end of each line:

    const line =
        "Multiline strings can be \
         created adding a backslash \
         at the end of each line";

    // This is just a convenience and doesn't actually introduce any line breaks:
    document.getElementById("text").innerText = line;

    // Template literals (string interpolation) are strings created with backticks.
    // JavaScript expressions can be placed inside ${} placeholders.
    // The result is concatenated as a single string.

    // If you need to use a special character in a string, such as a double quote in a double quoted string,
    // or a backslash, you need to precede it with another backslash:

    const s = "This is a backslash \\ and this is a double quote \"";
    console.log(s);
