<h1>Multiple transitions, same selection, different names, with chained unnamed sub-transitions</h1>
<p>All transitions on the same selections complete without interruptions because they have different names.
   The unnamed sub-transitions are chained to their parent transitions and also run without interruptions.
   See <code>transition-display.js</code> for event-handlers and console for more results. </p>
